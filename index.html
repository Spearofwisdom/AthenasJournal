            <h2 class="house__title">House Krayt-Dragon</h2>
            <p class="house__history">House Krayt-Dragon is an ancient noble house of the planet Thrustra, with ties
                to the early kings and queens of Thrustra or so it was written as such.
                Ruling in the northern hemisphere of Thrustra their people are not foreign to hardships, nor the cold.
                The early rulers of the region quickly found their funds left to them by their royal ancestors dried up
                It was the third petty king, Thalvax Krayt-Dragon, that is credited with truly setting the house on their
                path to dominance
                They gained their wealth early on by mining, but quickly went into banking and finally trade.
                With the wealth their house produced they were able to place it back into their own people's education making many
                of those under their rule scholars, their healthcare well taken care of and their research and development well
                funded. All men and women under their rule were conscripted into a mandatory service of ten years, and a reservist
                for twenty years afterwards, to them there was a difference between citizen and a civilian seeing those that never
                served Thrustra simply as civilians lowest on the totem pole, though the ruling members of the house did not
                need to serve each one led their people into battle and for that they were beloved.

                    Currently the ruler of House Krayt-Dragon, is Maethreh Krayt-Dragon, who took over after the sudden death of her
                    older sister Nali Krayt-Dragon and the abduction and assumed death of her heir Athena.
                    Her sister known as a very kind and benevolent ruler, she loved children and truly feeling as though they were the 
                    future of her people the education in her petty kingdom was some of the best as she invested in the arts, and 
                    built a medium size university. Though her daughter Athena was a half-breed she was nearly just as beloved as her 
                    mother. Remembered as a sweet and soft spoken child, at a young age she already had a sense of justice and honour
                    traits very few were surprised about given not only the lineage of her mother but the rumours of her father's lineage
                    being a Jedi master. To lose both at the same time was hard for the people, but luckily her younger sister was there
                    to help ease the pain. Though her sister is more known for her greed, arrogance, and wrath, she kept her people
                    together during those dark days. She wasn't beloved, but she was well respected.

                    <span class="legion__creed">"Strength in Sacrifice, Honour in Service, Purpose in Living"</span>
                This creed of the Krayt-Dragon military emphasizes the idea that true strength comes from making 
                sacrifices for a greater cause, while also finding purpose and meaning in one's life through service
                to others, such as friends, family, work, or nation in general. It highlights the importance of Living
                a life that is guided by honor, integrity, and selflessness, while pursuing a greater purpose beyond
                oneself. By embodying these values and living a life of service, military personnel can make a positive
                impact on the world and inspire others to do the same.
